      # This is a Personal Access Token or PAT from GitHub. You can find out how to generate this token, and more information
      # about setting up the GitHub integration here: https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/configuration#setting-up-a-github-integration
      token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
    ### Example for how to add your GitHub Enterprise instance using the API:
    # - host: ghe.example.net
    #   apiBaseUrl: https://ghe.example.net/api/v3
    #   token: ${GHE_TOKEN}

proxy:
  {}
  ### Example for how to add a proxy endpoint for the frontend.
  ### A typical reason to do this is to handle HTTPS and CORS for internal services.
  # endpoints:
  #   '/test':
  #     target: 'https://example.com'
  #     changeOrigin: true

auth:
  # see https://backstage.io/docs/auth/ to learn about auth providers
  # The guest provider allows unauthenticated access. This is suitable for
  # the Radius Dashboard which is intended to be accessible without login.
  # The ProxiedSignInPage automatically signs in through the backend guest
  # auth module with just a loading spinner, no user interaction required.
  # For production deployments that require authentication, configure a
  # proper auth provider like GitHub, Azure AD, or OIDC.

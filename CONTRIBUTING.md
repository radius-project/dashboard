## Developer Certificate of Origin

The Radius project follows the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). This is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

Visual Studio Code has a setting, `git.alwaysSignOff` to automatically add a Signed-off-by line to commit messages. Search for "sign-off" in VS Code settings to find it and enable it.

# Building the Radius Dashboard

## Prerequisites

- Install a modern version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). We use v21.X.X but other versions are ok.
- Enable corepack with `corepack enable`.

You'll also want an [environment](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/deploy-apps/environments/overview/) where you can experiment with Radius.

For development, we recommend VS Code. This repo is configured with recommended extensions that can automate parts of the development process when installed.

## Building the code

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
yarn install
```

**Build all packages:**

```bash
yarn workspaces foreach -A run build:all
```

**Build a specific package**

```bash
# Substitute rad-components with any package name
yarn workspace @radapp.io/rad-components run build
```

**Build the dashboard container**

```bash
yarn install
yarn tsc
yarn build:backend --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.dashboard.yaml
yarn build-image
```

The current `Dockerfile` is set up to build the container using state from the repo like the `node_modules/` folder. This is why the set of steps described above is required.

## Scripts

**Run a specific script in a specific package**

```bash
# Substitute rad-components with any package name
# Substitute link with any script name
yarn workspace @radapp.io/rad-components run lint
```
